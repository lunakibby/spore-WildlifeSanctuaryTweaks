# Wildlife Sanctuary Tweaks
Wildlife Enclosure Tweaks increases the total capacity of Zoo / Sanctuary Planets to a much higher value, allowing you to store more creatures there. Requires UPE (Universal Property Enhancer). This allows it to not conflict with other mods.

The mod has versions for an increase to 99 & 999!
